# Customer Actions Dashboard

The Customer Actions dashboard is the starting page for managing your actions.

Actions are shown in a set of lists including:

* Aufgabenliste: Actions for you, your To Do list
* Nicht zugewiesen: Actions for your roles that aren't assigned to anyone yet.  You can open and work in these
* Offen: Actions created by you that haven't been completed yet
* Abgeschlossen; Actions created by you that have been completed recently

Click on any action to open it.

You can only edit actions if you have permission and they are open - so you may be able to view all the details but not make changes.

On the right is a chart showing a breakdown of your To Do list by the type of the action.

Each action type has an icon.  In the dashboard, the icons change colour depending on their status.

- Green means they are Open
- Grey means they are Completed
- Red means they are Open and Overdue

When actions are created, they have a target date which means the date when the person would like to have them completed.

Once that target date is passed, open actions become red.

There is also a reminder on your Customer Actions To Do list at the top of every screen ![Action Status Icon](Docs/-images/CustomerActions/ActionStatusIcon.png)

See [Action Status Icon](javascript:linkTo("Action%20Status%20Icon")) for more details.
