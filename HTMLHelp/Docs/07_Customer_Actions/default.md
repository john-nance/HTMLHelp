# Customer Actions

Customer Actions are tasks that are tracked by the Sales Dashboard.

### Example: Requesting a CAD Drawing for a new Sales Opportunity.

The Account Manager has a Sales Opportunity and needs a new design.

They create a new "Design Request" action.

*Step 1: Create Request (Account Manager)*
In the first step he fills in some information and attaches documentation from the customer on the requirements.

*Step 2: Approve and Assign (Design Manager)*
The request goes to the Design Manager who reviews the request and assigns it to one of their team

*Step 3: Create Design (Designer)*
The work is scheduled for a Design who works on the request, attaches a picture of the new design

Each Customer Action is different. They can work across multiple departments and can have more than three steps - but the basic flow is similar to this.
