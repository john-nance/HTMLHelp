# Rich Notes

In some Customer Actions you will find some fields are "Rich Notes" which allow you to format the notes - a little bit like MS Word.

They look like normal notes, but when you click inside them you see the formatting tool bar.

# Entering Text

You can enter text as normal and also add some simple formatting such as **Bold** and *Italic*.

There is also support for bullet lists, numbered lists and simple tables.

# Pasting from MS Office (etc)

You can copy information from Word or Excel and paste it into these Rich Notes but be careful.

Word and Excel are very bad at formatting text. A few paragraphs or a table can look small but be 1,000's characters long with the formatting.

Each field is limited to 4,000 characters (about a page of A4 text).

Luckily this is a well known problem and when you paste from Word or Excel you will see a warning like this.

Always select to option to clean up the content.  You may lose some of the formatting but you can save 30x as much text.

You can also copy and paste information from Web sites.

Be a little careful.  When you copy and paste information including a picture, we only have a link to the picture so you will lose it if the web sites changes.
