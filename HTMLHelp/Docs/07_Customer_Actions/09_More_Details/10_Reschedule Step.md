# Reschedule Step

At the top of the Customer Action step is grey rescheduling box.

For completed steps it shows who completed the step and the date it was completed.

For open steps (that you control) it shows the planned start date and a RESCHEDULE button.

Clicking RESCHEDULE displays a calendar so you can quickly change the planned date.

Click SPEICHEN to save the new date.

(Or click RESCHEDULE again to exit without making changes)

You can also use the [Calendar](javascript:linkTo("Calendar")) to make smaller date and time changes.

# Working Days

The calendar uses working days and times.  

Assume your working hours are 09:00 to 17:30, Monday to Friday

You can start a 2 hour job at 17:00 on a Friday and the system will calculate that you need 2 working hours to complete the work.

That means you will finish at 10:30 the following Monday.

This can look a little strange in your diary since the work now extends over the entire weekend.
