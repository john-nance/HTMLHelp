# Action Status Icon

At the top of every page you can see the Action Status Icon ![Action Status Icon](Docs/-images/CustomerActions/ActionStatusIcon.png)

This is a quick indicator of your Customer Actions To Do list.  It shows how many customer actions are open and if any are overdue.

The colour of the icon is red if you have any overdue tasks.

The numbers alongside the icon show the number of open actions and overdue actions.

So in this example, there are 9 open actions with one overdue action.

Click the icon to go to the [Customer Action Dashboard](javascript:linkTo("Actions%20Dashboard")).
