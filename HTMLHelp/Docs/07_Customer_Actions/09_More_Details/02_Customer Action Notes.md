# Customer Action Notes

At the top of Customer Actions is an area for notes.  These notes can be used even after the action is closed.

It is designed so people can add notes and each note automatically includes:

* The name of the person who made the note
* The date the note was made

Once a note is added it cannot be edited so this is a log of historical actions.

Typically notes are used by people to record updates, for example to confirm that an action has been completed from a customer visit.-

## Adding a new Note

Simply enter your new note into the notes box.  Remember these are "notes" so keep them reasonably short.
