# Customer Action Documents

You can add documents (up to 5Mb) to Customer Actions.  Documents are used to give more detail and background.

They can also record key documents such as Contracts.

A document can be almost any type of information including:

* PDF
* Office document such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint
* Images such as photographs or CAD drawings

## Viewing Documents

At the top of every Customer Action is the menu bar which includes a paperclip icon.

If there is just a paperclip then there are no attachments

If any documents are attached to the Customer Action, the paperclip turns green and a note shows how many documents are attached.

If you hover over the document name, you will see a tooltip with the name of the person who uploaded the document and the date it was uploaded.

Click the document name to view it.
