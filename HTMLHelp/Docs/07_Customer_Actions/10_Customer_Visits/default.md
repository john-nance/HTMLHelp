# Customer Visits

Customer Visits are scheduled actions to see customers, or organise customers visiting us.

Customer Visits are a simple 2 step process

## 1. Plan a Visit

When do you plan to have the visit, what do you want to achieve, what do you need to prepare.

## 2. Report Results

Who attended, did you achieve your goals, what did you learn, and are there any follow up actions

## Background

It takes a lot of time and effort for our Account Managers to visit all our customers.  The Customer Visits module allows us to 

1. Encourage advance planning for visits
1. Make sure that we have clear goals and preparation
1. Capture every ounce of insight and make it easy for us to share it with our colleagures.

The dream is that a Designer working on a project will be able to see the original meeting that generated the opportunity and even look at the sales presentation.

In this way we reduce administration and avoid having to keep repeating the same information.  Reducing the workload on our sales teams.
