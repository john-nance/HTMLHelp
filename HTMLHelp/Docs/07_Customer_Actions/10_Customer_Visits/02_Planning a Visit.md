# Planning a Customer Visit

At the top of the Customer Visit is an overview of the Customer and Opportunity.  The opportunity information is only available if the visit is linked to an opportunity.

## Main Contact

By default the main or "key" contact for the customer is selected as the main contact for the visit.

You may be seeing many people but it's useful to see the name of the main contact person.  If you are not seeing the key contact, select the contact from the list and click SAVE.

## Action Header 

This header area is the same for all actions.  

The Customer name and Opportunity name are links to see the Customer or Opportunity.  Simply click the names to see more about them.

The Contact list is a list of all known contacts for this customer.

You can also see who originally created the Customer visit (normally that's you) and who is responsible for the next step.

The **Datum Benotigt** is the date when you expect to complete this action so it should be set to a date after the planned visit.  Customer Actions are special and this date will automatically be checked every time you save the customer visit.  If this date is wrong (before the current planned visit date) then it will be automatically updated.

There is an [area for notes](javascript:linkTo("Customer_Action_Notes")) which can be used at any time.

You can also [add documents, spreadsheets and presentations](javascript:linkTo("Customer%20Action%20Documents")) to the customer visit.

## Planning

Now you can plan the meeting.

Each visit has a title which is used to describe the purpose of the meeting.  It defaults to "Visit to Customer" but it's much better to give it an accurate title, for example, "Discussion on Transport Costs".

Next select a date and time for the meeting.  This may not be confirmed yet and can be changed later.  Click on the date and you can select a Date from the Calendar.  There are sliders to pick a start time for the meeting.

The next box is the approximate duration of the meeting in minutes, it defaults to 60 but this can be changed.

Remember you can SAVE the customer action at any time, so you don't have to complete everything immediately.  You can SAVE the action and come back to it later - it will be visible in your [Customer Actions Dashboard](javascript:linkTo("Actions%20Dashboard")).

Now enter the location for the meeting. This can be the full address or just the town if you're familiar with the location.

Now fill in the other fields including:

### Ziele

Why are you planning the meeting.  Do you have specific objectives such as winning an opportunity, agreeing price changes or gaining insight to their purchasing plans?

You can type into this field or paste information from Word or Excel.  If pasting information, always select the option to clean up the content.

See [Rich Notes](javascript:linkTo("Customer%20Action%20Rich%20Notes")) for more details.

### Vorbereitung

Do you need to prepare anything.  Perhaps looking at their recent orders?

We will shortly be managing Complaints so it's well worth checking there are no open issues.

## Next

Once you have entered the information, click NEXT to move the next stage.

The next step is [Reporting on the results of the Customer Visit](javascript:linkTo("Reporting%20on%20Customer%20Visit"))

## More Information

You can view and edit your customer visits in your [Calendar](javascript:linkTo("Calendar")).  This includes changing the date and time of the meeting.
