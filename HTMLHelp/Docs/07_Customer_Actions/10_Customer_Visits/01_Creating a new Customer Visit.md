# Creating a new Customer Visit

There are two ways to create a new Customer Visit.

## Opportunity Customer Visit 

If you are mainly visiting the customer to discuss an existing opportunity, then you go to the opportunity dashboard and select the opportunity.

Now select the Add Action icon at the top of the page and select Customer Visit.

A new Customer Visit for this customer *and this opportunity* is created and you can start [planning your visit](javascript:linkTo("Planning%20a%20Visit")).

## General Customer Visit

If this is a general visit and not focussed on a Sales Opportunity, then go to the Customers page.

Select the customer so you can see their details.

Now select the Add Action icon at the top of the page and select Customer Visit.

A new Customer Visit for this customer is created and you can start [planning your visit](javascript:linkTo("Planning%20a%20Visit")).
