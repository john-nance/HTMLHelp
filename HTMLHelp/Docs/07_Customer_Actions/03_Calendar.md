# Calendar

The Calendar gives a week-based view of your customer actions.

The red line shows the current date and time.

On the left is a 3 month calendar.  Click any week in the 3 month calendar to view a different date.

Warning: It can take a while to read and display the appointments - so wait a second or two after changing the date.

## Viewing more details

Click once on any action to see more details.  A tooltip shows information about the action.

Double click to open the action.

## Changing the Date

You can drag the action to a new date.  A grey box shows where it will be moved to.

This is great for moving a few days earlier or later but is very slow if you need to move it several weeks.  Use the [Reschedule](javascript:linkTo("Reschedule%20Step")) feature for bigger changes.

# Working Days

The calendar uses working days and hours.  

Assume your working hours are 09:00 to 17:30, Monday to Friday

You can start a 2 hour job at 17:00 on a Friday and the system will calculate that you need 2 working hours to complete the work.

That means you will finish at 10:30 the following Monday.

This can look a little strange in your diary since the work now extends over the entire weekend.
