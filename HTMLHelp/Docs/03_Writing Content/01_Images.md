# Images

Images are in a folder called "-images".

Any folders beginning with a minus sign are hidden from the index - so you don't see this images folder in the menu on the left.

Pages are rendered from the root of the application so the path to images is always Docs/-images/...

```
![pureHelp Screenshot](Docs/-images/pureHelp/IntroPage.png)
```

As you can see in this example, you can use folders under -images to organise your media.

The default styling is to set images to full size unless they are wider than the display area, in which case they are resized to fit the window.

You can link to images outsite the pureHelp system by giving a full url - but this will break your images if the images are moved.

## Image Sizes

There is no point in having massive images.  The smaller their file size the quicker tey will load.  

These are help pages for screen viewing so they should look good on a normal screen/tablet.
