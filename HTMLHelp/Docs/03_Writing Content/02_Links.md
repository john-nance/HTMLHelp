# Linking to other pages

You can link using standard Markdown but there is a small script called "linkTo" which makes it easier.

### Markdown

In Markdown use the following code for a link to anther page.

```
   [Link Description](javascript:linkTo("Help_Page_Name"))
```

Where "Help Page Name" is the name of the pages as seen in the help menu on the left. Use underscores (or %20) instead of spaces (Markdown doesn't like spaces in urls).

To link to other web pages, simple use normal [Markdown](linkTo("Markdown").

See also [Check Links](javascript:linkTo("Links")) for the utility to check all links in your content.
