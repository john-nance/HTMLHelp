# Markdown

Help pages can be written in HTML or Markdown.  

I prefer Markdown for help pages because:

* It's quicker and easier to edit
* The text is more readable
* I don't forget to add line breaks
* **Much** harder to go crazy with formatting and styling so the help pages always look consistent

## Quick Guide

There are hundreds of Markdown guides that are better than anything I could write.  It's really easy to learn. 

Search for *Markdown*.

## More Details

See the pages on [Links](javascript:linkTo("Links")) and [Images](javascript:linkTo("Images")) for some tips and tools specific to pureHelp.

I recommend Visual Studio Code Editor from Microsoft if you're editing a lot of Markdown content.  Open the Docs area as a workspace and you can see and navigate all your help content.
