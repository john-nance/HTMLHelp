# pureHelp

pureHelp is a simple ASP.Net application for help information.

Help pages are created in the Docs folder of a web site as folders and markdown pages.

The application scans the content of the Docs folder, creates a help index and displays the content.

There's nothing sophisticated, it's just a quick easy way to create attractive help pages that can be updated easily.

Here are some suggestions for exploring further:

* [Using pureHelp](javascript:linkTo("Using_pureHelp")), using the help index and navigation
* [Creating Help Pages](javascript:linkTo("Writing_Content")), How to write help pages
* [Embedded Links](javascript:linkTo("Links")), linking to other help pages
* [Images](javascript:linkTo("Images")), adding and showing images

Why pureHelp? My company is called [pureXML](https://pureXML.com) - so why not!
