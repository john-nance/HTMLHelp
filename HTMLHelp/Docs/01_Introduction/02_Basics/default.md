## Who are you?

At the top right you should see your name.

You may have permission to "impersonate" someone else, for example if you are covering some of the work of a colleague who is on holiday.  In this case you will see you name and in brackets the name of the person you are working as (impersonating).

See [Impersonate](javascript:linkTo("Impersonate")) for more information.
