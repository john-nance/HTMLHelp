# Impersonate

Sometimes it is useful to be able to use the Sales Dashboard impersonating as a collegue.

The Sales Dashboard knows you are impersonating a collegue and will record your real identity on any changes.

Here are some scenarios where Impersonate is useful:

* Sales Meetings when the Sales Manager can Impersonate each member of their team to make it easier to show their forecast, customers, etc.
* Covering a colleagues abscense due to holidays or illness
* Assisting a colleague, perhaps because they are new or overloaded

You need permission to impersonate any person.  This can be permanent permission or assigned temporarily.

## Impersonating one of my team

If you lead a team, you have the permenant permission to impersonate the members of your team.

Click Impersonate in the menu.

Select the team member in the Teammitglied list.  The change is made immediately and you will see your name and the person you are impersonating at the top of the screen.

## Seeing just my Customers

If you are a Sales Manager, you will see your Customers and your team's customers.

If you just want to see your customers, click the check box "Eigene Kundun".

This will be remembered until you log out or use the RESET button.

## Assigning a Co-Worker

If you are a manager, you can temporarily allow one of your team to impersonate another member of your team.

First select the person who will be impersonating a colleague, then the person being impersonated and finally the end date.

They will be able to impersonate their colleague until this date (inclusive).

You can see all temporary assignments and delete them if no longer required.
