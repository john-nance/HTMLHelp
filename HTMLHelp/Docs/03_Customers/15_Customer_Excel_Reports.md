# Customers Excel Reports

At the top right of the customers page are two Excel reports.

The first report with a box icon, generates an Article Portfolio in Excel, the second a Customer List.

## Article Portfolio

This report will only work when you have selected a customer.

It shows article sales for the customer with analysis pages.

You can filter the information by:

* Plant
* Product Group
* Article Number
* Sales Band (1 = top selling products, 5 = very low sales)

## Customer List

This takes the current list of customers and generates an Excel list.  

If you filter the Customer List, then you will get the same filtered list in Excel.

The report includes details of Revenue and Volume for this year plus the forecast details per customer.
