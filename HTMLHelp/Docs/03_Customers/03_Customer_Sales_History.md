# Customer Sales History Tab

The Sales History tab shows a graph of monthly invoice totals for the selected customer or group.

There is one bar per month which is colour coded by product group.  Hover over a bar to see more details.

The gold dashed line shows the planned budget for the customer month by month so ideally we want sales to be above the dashed line.

The green dashed line shows the trend over the last six complete months.

Initially the graph shows Invoice Volume in square metres.  Click the UMSATZ button to see revenue.

You can also see details for the last 50 Orders and Invoices in the Recent Orders tab.

Some customers are invoiced at the end of the month so the bar for the current month can be lower than expected.
