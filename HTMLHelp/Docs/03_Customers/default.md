# Customers

The Customers page is at the heart of the sales dashboard.

You can browse your customers and select from a wide range of information

## Security

You should be able to see all the customers you work with.

Account Managers and Customer Service see the customers they manage.  Other people see different customers depending on their permissions.

You may not have access to all the information for every customer - so you may see fewer menus and customer details. 

## Getting Started

When you first select Customers, you see a list of all your customers and a chart with revenue for the last two years.  The list shows customers with the largest Year to Date revenue first.

Customers can be in a group - there is + in the list of customers to show the group details. 

You can click on a Customer to see their details.
